# AOC 2024 with Haskell

## Description
This project contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges implemented in Haskell. Each day's challenge is organized into separate modules, allowing for easy navigation and testing of individual solutions.

## Modules
- **Day1**: Contains functions to calculate total distances between two lists of integers.
- **Day1Part2**: Implements a similarity score calculation between two lists.
- **Day2**: Provides functions to check the safety of reports based on certain criteria.
- **Day3**: Extracts and sums multiplication results from a given input format.

## Usage
To build and run the project, use the following commands:

```
$ cabal build
$ cabal run
```

## Input Files
The input files for each day's challenge should be placed in the `src/input/` directory. The expected filenames are:
- `1.txt` for Day 1
- `2.txt` for Day 2
- `3.txt` for Day 3

Make sure to populate these files with the appropriate input data for the challenges.
